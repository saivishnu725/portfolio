                        hacker movies from his/her tech page in Instagram or the first thing you'd read from the
                        Wikipedia or IMDb page of this show but that is not what I am going to say because that is not
                        the apt definition of what this show actually is.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>Well, the show might involve a hacker and some (lots of) hacking scenes but honestly at it's
                        core it's not a show with hacking as the primary topic but instead about mental illness.
                        <br>
                        If the only thing you hear about this show is that it involves hacking and some hackers then you
                        obviously are going to create a mind image of green screens with some Matrix stuff floating
                        around on the screen and the guy typing with a 5000+ WPM speed and then next thing you know he
                        has access to any organisation he wishes. But then when you face the reality that the hacking
                        tools/methods used are 100% legit and they don't just say some crap to get things done like they
                        do in the rest of Hollywood and like how we are used to seeing then you are prone to get bored
                        and also to make things worse the theme of the show and the complexity it actually possess turns
                        a lot of them down so I am writing this to make a change in some people's mindset towards this
                        marvelous show and to appreciate it's beauty.

                        It changed me in ways even I couldn't believe was possible. It has such a significant influence
                        on almost every minute part of my life ever since. I can't write how grateful I am to it.
                        <br>
                        This was my first ever TV show and the best of all the other shows I've watched every since. It
                        was in June, 2019 and I asked a friend of mine to recommend me a TV show to start the journey
                        and he suggested Mr. Robot without any hesitation and I thank him till date for this one
                        decision.

                        I get asked why I promote Mr. Robot and Fight Club as if someone pays me to do this job and I
                        honestly don't have a valid enough answer for this question. From what I understand, I sense
                        something wrong with everyone around me. I think these two express it to some extent.And also
                        most of my thoughts either revolve around them or Linux and since I have no one to talk to about
                        either of them IRL, I think most (99.99%) of them just get lost and it just feels bad so it's
                        just a unconscious attempt to fix it.
                        <br>
                        If this won't change everyone's mind (i think most of them haven't reached this far to begin
                        with), that's fine until it influences at least one of them because I'd feel this kind of
                        satisfaction.
                        <br>
                        Thank you for reading this . Have a nice day :)
